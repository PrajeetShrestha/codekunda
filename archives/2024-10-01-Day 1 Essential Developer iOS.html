<p>Today, I enrolled in the Essential Developer program! I've wanted to join this program for a long time to sharpen my knowledge base, and I'm thrilled to finally be part of it.</p>

<p>Being from Nepal, it was quite a challenge to enroll due to two main reasons:</p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
  <li><strong>The cost</strong>: The program costs almost $2000 USD, which is quite high for Nepalese standards. However, I'm taking the leap of faith and investing in myself.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment hurdles</strong>: We don't have direct means to make international payments through banking channels in Nepal. Our cards work only inside the country, so I had to make the payment using Bitcoin. Fortunately, I had invested in some BTC back in 2017, which helped me enroll in the course.</li>
</ol>

<p>After some initial hiccups with making the payment through BTC, I finally enrolled today.</p>

<p>This is my first day in the <em>iOS Lead Essentials</em> program, and I can't wait to dive deeper into it.</p>


<h2> Notes </h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Need to complete each and every course</li>
    <li>Join slack to interact with other developers</li>
    <li>Before start of the cohort, a virtual day starts in which the mentors give a session on how to make most out of this program. It's five days after today so I have yet to attend the virtual day</li>

</ol>
