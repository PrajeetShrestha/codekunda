  This marks the beginning of CodeKunda. For all these years I wanted to make a
  blog, share my experience, share my knowledge and archive it for myself and
  for the like mindeds. I wanted to get feedback from the community and validate
  my knowledge.
</p>
</br>
<p>
  I explored lot of options, wordpress, tried to create a SPA with Angular or
  React. But it never came to fruition. Either due to lack of my knowledge or
  lack of flexibility of the selected blogging tool.
</p>
</br>
<p>
  Finally, I stumbled into Jekyll. And it clicked with me in an instant. It has
  a balance between flexibiliy that I wanted to have and ease of use. I am still
  learning it but so far loving it.
