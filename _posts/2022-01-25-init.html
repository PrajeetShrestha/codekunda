<p>
	This marks the beginning of CodeKunda. For all these years I wanted to make
	a blog, share my experience, share my knowledge and archive it for myself
	and for the like mindeds. I wanted to get feedback from the community and
	validate my knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	I explored lot of options, wordpress, tried to create a SPA with Angular or
	React. But it never came to fruition. Either due to lack of my knowledge or
	lack of flexibility of the selected blogging tool. I always found something
	missing in popular blogging tools.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, I stumbled into Jekyll. And it clicked with me in an instant. It
	has a balance between flexibiliy that I wanted to have and ease of use. I am
	still learning it but so far loving it. The static nature of Jekyll is also
	great, since it means that the site loading is super fast and definitely
	give a obvious boost for SEO as well.

<p>
	A lot of goodies on the pipeline stay tuned! Also if you have any
	suggestions and recommendations drop email at
