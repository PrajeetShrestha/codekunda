<h2>Setting up NodeJs</h2>
<p>Setting up NodeJs is pretty straight forward in mac.</p>
<p>
	Download the installer for your respective device
	<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" class="link">here</a>
	and after running the installer. Go to terminal and check the installed
	version of the node.
	<br />
	<code> node -v </code>
</p>
<p>
	If you want to go further and execute your first node application, you can
	use the command below in terminal. Just take a note of your current working
	directory.
	<code>
		echo "console.log('hello world')" > app.js
		<br />
		node app.js
	</code>
	You can see <strong>hello world</strong> printed in the terminal. What you
	just did is to simply create a javascript file called
	<strong>app.js</strong> from the terminal and execute it with
	<strong>nodejs</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Installing MongoDB</h2>
<p>
	You would want to try to install a community edition for MongoDB first. You
	can get it from
	<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community" class="link"
		>here</a
	>
	<br />
	After extracting the downloaded file you would get a folder named
	<strong>mongodb-macOS***</strong> rename the folder to just
	<strong>mongodb</strong> for ease of use.
</p>
<p>
	Now go the the folder (Downloads folder normally) in which you extracted the
	mongodb in terminal. And type below commands:
	<code>
		cp -a $PWD/mongodb ~
		<span class="comment"># copy the folder to the home directory</span>
		<br />
		cd ~ <span class="comment"># go to the home directory</span>
		<br />
		mkdir mongodb-data
		<span class="comment"
			># create a folder named mongodb-data, used for storing collections
			and other meta-data</span
		>
	</code>
</p>

<h2>Running mongodb server</h2>
<p>
	In terminal type below commands:
	<code>
		~/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=~/mongodb-data
		<span class="comment"># starts mongodb server</span>
	</code>

	This initiates mongodb server and starts listening on port 27017. Don't
	close the tab in terminal yet or the server might stop.
</p>

<h2>Connect to mongodb server with GUI</h2>
<p>
	There are various tools available for connecting to mongodb server. 
	<ul>
		<li>MongoDB Compass: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass" class="link">Download</a></li>
		<li>Robo: <a href="https://robomongo.org/download" class="link">Download</a></li>
	</ul>	
	</p>
	<p>
		My Personal favorite is MongoDB Compass. After downloading and executing the installer. Open MongoDB Compass
		press Command + N to open a new connection. 
		You will see UI as below:
		<img src={{"/assets/images/posts/article2/compass.png" | relative_url }} class="illustration">
		Make sure hostname is localhost and port is 27017 and just hit connect. 
		You will see default collections already initialized like admin, config etc. Ignore it for now. 
		<br>
		You are all set for first CRUD application in MongoDB with NodeJs. But, That will be in second part of this tutorial.
		<br>
		Stay tuned :)
