<h2>Setting up NodeJs</h2>
<p>
	Setting up NodeJs is pretty straight forward in mac. 
</p>
<p>
Download the installer for your respective device 
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" class="link">here</a> 
and after running the installer. Go to terminal and check the installed version of the node. 
<br>
<code>
	node -v
</code>
</p>
<p>
	If you want to go further and execute your first node application, you can use the command below 
	in terminal. Just take a note of your current working directory.
	<code>
		echo "console.log('hello world')" > app.js
		<br>
		node app.js
	</code>
	You can see <strong>hello world</strong> printed in the terminal. What you just did is to simply 
	create a javascript file called <strong>app.js</strong> from the terminal and execute it with 
	<strong>nodejs</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Installing MongoDB</h2>
<p>
	You would want to try to install a community edition for MongoDB first. You can get it from 
	<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community" class="link">here</a>
	<br> 
	After extracting the downloaded file you would get a folder named <strong>mongodb-macOS***</strong> 
	rename the folder to just <strong>mongodb</strong> for ease of use.
</p>
<p>
	Now go the the folder (Downloads folder normally) in which you extracted the mongodb in terminal.
	And type below commands:
	<code>
		cp -a $PWD/mongodb ~ <span class="comment"># copy the folder to the home directory</span>
		<br>
		cd ~ <span class="comment"># go to the home directory</span>
		<br>
		mkdir mongodb-data <span class="comment"># create a folder named mongodb-data, used for storing collections and other meta-data</span>
	</code>
</p>

<h2>Running mongodb server</h2>
<p>
In terminal type below commands:
<code>
	~/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=~/mongodb-data <span class="comment"># starts mongodb server</span>
</code>
	
This initiates mongodb server and starts listening on port 27017. Don't close the tab in 
terminal yet or the server might stop.
</p>

<h2> Connect to mongodb server with GUI</h2> 
<p>
There are various tools available for connecting to mongodb server. 
<ul>
	<li>MongoDB Compass: <span><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass" class="link">Download</a></span></li>
	<li>Robo: <span><a href="https://robomongo.org/download" class="link">Download</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
	My personal favorite is MongoDB Compass
