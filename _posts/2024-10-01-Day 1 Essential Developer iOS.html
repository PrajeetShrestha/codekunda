# Day 1 - Essential Developer
So today I enrolled into essential developer program. I wanted to enroll into this program for long time in order to sharpen my knowledge base. Finally got it today. 
So being from Nepal it was hard for me to enroll into the course, due to two primary reasons. 
1. The cost of the program is really high 2000 USD almost. For Nepalese it's high but I am taking the leap of faith. 
2. We don't have direct means to pay internationally through banking chanels in Nepal. Our cards will work inside Nepal only and for that reason I had make payment from BTC. Fortnately I had some BTC because I invested in some of it way back in 2017 and it help me enroll into this course. 
With initial hiccups in making payment through BTC I finally enrolled today. 


Today is the first time I enrolled into the program. *iOS Lead Essentials*. 
This is the first time I am using
